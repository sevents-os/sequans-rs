/// Note: SIM PIN, SIM PUK, PH-SIM PIN, PH-FSIM PIN, PH-FSIM PUK, SIM PIN2 and SIM PUK2 refer to the PIN of the selected application on the UICC. For example, in an UTRAN context, the selected application on the currently selected UICC should be a USIM and the SIM PIN then represents the PIN of the selected USIM. See 3GPP TS 31.101 [65] for further details on application selection on the UICC.

/// If the PIN required is SIM PUK or SIM PUK2, the second PIN is required. This second PIN, â€¹newpin>, is used to replace the old PIN in the SIM.
